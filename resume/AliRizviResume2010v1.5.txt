This application saved an estimated 160 hours in Q4 2009 alone (with similar projected saving in future years). This project required working closely with business owners, gathering requirements, creating user stories, estimating and planning releases in very challenging and time constrained environment.
* Developed discrete event based stochastic Simulation of Inventory Availability in a complex fulfillment network topology as part of strategic planning initiative whose results were presented to the CEO. This was an extremely challenging project because of a very aggressive schedule (2 months) that required simulating a very complicated fulfillment network. 
* Saved 169 Business Analysts Hours in one quarter (Q4 2008) by automating the expedited purchase order process. The times savings continually accumulated and were basis for further improvements in the system.

Amazon is an established authoritative source of product data which results in a confident customer experience that they know exactly what they are buying. Item Data Quality (IDQ) initiative had the goal of ensuring the quality of item data by proactively detecting and fixing any data quality issues. Being one of the first engineers in the team I am proud of several data quality initiatives that enhanced Amazon customer experience. 
Selected Achievements:

Developed a model to detect brand values like MS, Microsoft, MicroSoft in the entire Amazon catalog and normalize them into one canonical value.
* Developed the IDQ Sampler system for auditing data quality. This technique involve intelligently selecting items for manual audit, providing an effective user interface for auditors and implementing complex statistical calculation to present the findings.
* Developed Duplicate Merge Interface to eradicate duplication of product pages for the same item. This required working across teams and integrating their API to come up with one stop user interface for a complicated process.
* Designed and Architected Item Quality Infrastructure including IDQ Service that was used for reporting data quality issues and surfacing the results to the IDQ Dashboard for business users. The service had a high throughput requirement because of the large amount of product data and potential defects.
* Single handedly enhanced and maintained the mission critical Toys R US Exclusivity Portal (during the $200 million lawsuit) and Tools which required collaboration with item master, legal and business teams responsible for ensuring compliance to court order with a strict SLA (service level agreement).
